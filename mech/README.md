# AVR ATMega328P incidence meter 3D mechanical model

This project implements an incidence meter to measure airfoil angles on RC planes. The project uses an AVR ATMega328p, a set of seven segment LED modules, and an I2C accelerometer module.

The parts are all 3D printer with PLA. Additional items include:
- "L" shaped aluminum angle rod 1/16" thin x 1/2" x 12" Home Depot SKU# 195627
- #6-32 x 1" screws and lock nuts
- #4 3/8" pan head sheet metal screws
